* Setting Up org-protocol on Mac

[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#orgheadline6][org-protocol.el – Mac OS X setup]] doesn't work anymore according to [[https://github.com/neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app/issues/3][Issue #3 ·
neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app]].

** Step 1. Create an application

- Launch the Script Editor application and create a new document
- Copy-and-paste the following code into the new document
- Change "/usr/local/bin/emacsclient" to path to =emacsclient= on your system
- Save it in /Application/ (not the default /Script/) File Format as
  =org-protocol.app=

#+BEGIN_SRC applescript
on open location this_URL
	tell application "Emacs" to activate
	do shell script "/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin-x86_64-10_14/emacsclient \"" & this_URL & "\""
end open location
#+END_SRC

Note that the script tells Emacs to activate *before* starting =emacsclient=. This
is done in order to work around a bug in graphical Emacs that causes =emacsclient=
to block instead of returning immediately, even when =emacsclient= is launched
with the =--no-wait= option.

** Step 2. Configure the application

- Navigate to the application (i.e., =org-protocol.app=) in the Finder, then
  right-click on it and select =Show Package Contents=. Now go into the
  =Contents= folder and open =Info.plist=
- Add the following code to the file, making sure to keep all existing
  key/string pairs intact:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
  <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
  <array>
    <dict>
      <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
      <string>org-protocol handler</string>
      <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
      <array>
        <string>org-protocol</string>
      </array>
    </dict>
  </array>
#+END_SRC

** Step 3. Test your results

* Notes

** User Script

On web browser, besides bookmarklets, you can also use User Script, for example,
[[./org-protocol.user.js]] binds two keys to Org: store-link and Org: capture.
