* Setting Up org-protocol on Mac

[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#orgheadline6][org-protocol.el – Mac OS X setup]] doesn't work anymore according to [[https://github.com/neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app/issues/3][Issue #3 ·
neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app]].

** Step 1. Create an application

- Launch the Script Editor application and create a new document
- Copy-and-paste the following code into the new document
- Run =where emacsclient= in cli to get the path to =emacsclient= on your system
- Change "/path/to/your/emacsclient" to the result of =where emacsclient= 
- Save it in /Application/ (not the default /Script/) File Format as
  =org-protocol.app=

#+BEGIN_SRC applescript
on open location this_URL
	do shell script "/path/to/your/emacsclient \"" & this_URL & "\""
	tell application "Emacs" to activate
end open location
#+END_SRC

** Step 2. Configure the application

- Navigate to the application (i.e., =org-protocol.app=) in the Finder, then
  right-click on it and select =Show Package Contents=. Now go into the
  =Contents= folder and open =Info.plist=
- Add the following code to the file, making sure to keep all existing
  key/string pairs intact:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
  <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
  <array>
    <dict>
      <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
      <string>org-protocol handler</string>
      <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
      <array>
        <string>org-protocol</string>
      </array>
    </dict>
  </array>
#+END_SRC

** Step 3. Install the protocol

To register the protocol, just click on the =org-protocol.app=.

** Step 4. Test your results

* Notes

** Emacs doesn't activate?

I use graphical Emacs and start Emacs server from there, however after clicking
some org-protocol link, Emacs doesn't activate. I don't know the cause. If you
encounter the same issue AND don't like it, you can try this instead

#+BEGIN_SRC applescript
  on open location this_URL
     do shell script "/usr/local/bin/emacsclient \"" & this_URL & "\" && open -a Emacs"
  end open location
#+END_SRC

** User Script

On web browser, besides bookmarklets, you can also use User Script, for example,
[[./org-protocol.user.js]] binds two keys to Org: store-link and Org: capture.
